## First In Our Field

Temple’s Department of Africology and African American Studies is one of the oldest of similar departments in the nation, and we were the first to offer a doctoral program in our field.

## National And International

We constantly seek to expand links with the local, national and international African community. We always encourage our students to take advantage of opportunities to do service learning, internships and study abroad — including a summer program in Ghana.

## Meet a Mentor

We place great emphasis on enhanced mentoring and advising in the interest of a cooperative pedagogy. Our department fosters academic excellence, student achievement, social responsibility, character maturity and political engagement as expressions of the best African academic traditions.
