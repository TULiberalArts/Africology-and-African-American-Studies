## Bachelor of Arts in Africology and African American Studies

The Africology and African American Studies program at Temple University provides undergraduates with the opportunity to critically examine and interpret the experiences, traditions and dynamics of people of African descent. Africology, an interdisciplinary discipline, studies the culture of Africans and the African diaspora. Students are guided through scholarly reflection by leaders in the field.

Our curriculum stresses critical thinking, persuasive writing and problem solving skills. You'll be exposed to Africana theory and encouraged to engage in research and service outside the classroom walls. If you study at our department, you'll join an energetic group of scholars and learners who seek to continue what began more than forty years ago.

## Financial Aid and Scholarships

If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance
