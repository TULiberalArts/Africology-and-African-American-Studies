## Program Overview

The undergraduate program in African American Studies at Temple University is dedicated to providing students with an invigorating intellectual experience centered on the inspiring contributions and challenges that Africans, continental and diaspora, have made and confronted on the road to human excellence. Our students are exposed to national and international leaders in African American Studies who constantly push the boundaries of learning from the base of African culture, history, literature, and languages toward the exhilarating knowledge of self and community. With a strong focus on the interrelationship of the African experience in the Americas and the Caribbean our professors are able to guide undergraduate students toward new ways of viewing economic and political realities, ethnic and cultural relationships, religion, and language. Our undergraduate courses are meant to prepare the student for critical and analytical research and creativity. Every opportunity is taken to embrace the student as a significant learner in a vigorous community of researchers and learners. Indeed, Philadelphia, one of the oldest sites of African presence in the United States, is a laboratory for much of our research and teaching.

The goal of the department of African-American Studies is to prepare its majors and minors to take roles of effective agency, participation, and leadership in the intellectual, research, and social activist domains of professional and community life. Templeâ€™s African-American Studies majors are represented in such diverse career arenas as law, primary and secondary education and administration, social work, medicine, cultural and artistic institutions, law enforcement, and city government.]
