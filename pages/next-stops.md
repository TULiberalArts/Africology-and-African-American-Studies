Like Temple Owls, AAAS graduates are everywhere. Training in African American Studies provides the foundation and tools needed not only to guide your personal and professional aspirations, but also to ensure success in an increasingly cross-cultural and inter-dependent world. Our graduates work in professional areas that include government, social work, international relations, education, non-profits and in cultural or artistic institutions. Many of our former doctoral students head African American Studies at major universities. Some of our former MA students have received their doctorates in other fields and from different universities and are now professors.
