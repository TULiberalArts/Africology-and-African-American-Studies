## Department Resources

### Charles L. Blockson Collection

The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University houses over 500,000 items on the global Black experience dating from 1581 to the present. Located in Sullivan Hall, the extensive catalog is the first to be published by a major university. Donated in 1984, Mr. Blockson chose Temple University to house his collection because of our diverse student body and location in the heart of the African American community in North Philadelphia.

### Journal of Black Studies

Our department is the home to the Journal of Black Studies, the most prestigious journal in the discipline of African American Studies. The leading source for innovative and creative research on the Black experience, the journal is published six times per year. Africology and African American Studies Students have the opportunity to work with the journal alongside our distinguished faculty members.

### The Encyclopedia of Black Studies

Two of Templeâ€™s faculty members, Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama, edited the Encyclopedia of Black Studies. The encyclopedia is leading reference source for dynamic and innovative research on the Black experience. The concept for the encyclopedia was developed from the successful Journal of Black Studies and contains a full analysis of the economic, political, sociological, historical, literary and philosophical issues related to Americans of African descent.

### Study Abroad in Ghana

If you join our department, the opportunity to study abroad in Ghana is an incredible way to enhance your Temple education. Investigate the historical, literary, cultural and linguistic aspects of West African civilization at the University of Ghana in Accra. Experience the warm culture and booming music scene of Accra, all while adding new depth to your Africology and African American Studies research. 

### Financial Aid and Scholarships

Deciding how to pay for your education is a major financial decision. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University use to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. 

The department also offers a limited number of assistantships for graduate students on a highly competitive basis. These awards usually involve teaching; teaching assistants receive a stipend and full tuition remission up to 9 credits. African American Studies students with outstanding academic records are also eligible for other awards and scholarships. Student Financial Services has more information.
