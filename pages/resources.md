## Graduate Resources

### Department Resources

The Charles Blockson Afro American Collection located in Sullivan Hall on Temple’s main campus is one of the great resources in the United States. Mr. Blockson began his collection as a teenager and after many years had built his collection into the fourth or fifth largest such collection in the nation. Many of our students regularly use the Blockson facility for their research.

The department is the home to the Journal of Black Studies, the most prestigious journal in the discipline of African American Studies. Students have the opportunity to work with the journal. Two of Temple’s faculty members in African American Studies edited the Encyclopedia of Black Studies and much of the discourse about the nature of the field remains a hefty debate in seminars in the department.
