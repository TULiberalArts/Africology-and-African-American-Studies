## Study Abroad in Ghana
If you join our department, taking advantage of our [study abroad in Ghana program](https://studyabroad.temple.edu/scholarships/aaas-scholarship-for-temple-summer-in-ghana) is an incredible way to enhance your Temple education. Investigate the historical, literary, cultural and linguistic aspects of West African civilization at the University of Ghana in Accra. Experience the warm culture and booming music scene of the nation's capital while adding depth to your Africology and African American Studies research.

## Journal of Black Studies
Our department is the home to the _Journal of Black Studies_, the most prestigious publication in the discipline of African American Studies. A leading source for innovative and creative research on the black experience, the journal is published six times per year. Africology and African American Studies Students can work with the journal under the guidance of our distinguished faculty.

## The Encyclopedia of Black Studies
Two of Temple’s faculty members, Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama, edited the Encyclopedia of Black Studies. It is the leading reference source for dynamic and innovative research on the black experience. The concept for the encyclopedia was developed from the successful _Journal of Black Studies_ and contains a full analysis of the economic, political, sociological, historical, literary and philosophical issues related to Americans of African descent.

## National Council on Black Studies
The department of Africology and African American Studies is accredited by the National Council on Black  Studies (NCBS). NCBS was established in 1975 by African American scholars who recognized the need to formalize the study of the African world experience, as well as expand and strengthen academic units and community programs devoted to that endeavor. NCBS holds an annual conference and publishes the _International Journal of African Studies_.

## Charles L. Blockson Collection
The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University houses over 500,000 items on the global black experience. Dating from 1581 to the present, the extensive catalog is the first of its kind published by a major university. Mr. Blockson chose Temple University for his collection because of our diverse student body and our location in the heart of the African American community in North Philadelphia.
