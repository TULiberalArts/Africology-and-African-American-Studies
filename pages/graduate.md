## First in the Field of African American Studies

The African presence and experience has shaped the social, political, economic, cultural, intellectual and psychological landscape of the United States and the world. The Department of Africology and African American Studies provides graduate and doctoral level students with an Afrocentric study of the history, culture, art, politics and economics of Africans and people of African descent globally. Afrocentricity is a paradigm that suggests African people should re-assert agency in their narratives. 

We are known for our innovation, energy and influence. Our faculty edits the top journal in our discipline, the Journal of Black Studies, and publishes in international journals. We participate in all significant associations, and maintain a high profile in domestic and international conferences. 

### PhD in African American Studies

Temple is the first University that offer a PhD program in African American Studies.  Graduates engage in a diverse range of intellectual issues that affect the lives of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora. The program reflects a deep commitment to the self-directed study of African peoples. Our students are prepared for university teaching and scholarly research. Our graduates have an excellent track record of employment based on their area of academic concentration. They work in academia, university or high school administration, public and, the entertainment industry, criminal justice, journalism, public relations or social work.

### MA in African American Studies

The MA in African American Studies is designed to teach students about fundamental theoretical and practical issues confronting African people trans-continentally and trans-generationally. The MA program seeks to answer personal and intellectual aspirations of students that are not satisfied by a BA degree in African American Studies. An MA in African American Studies often serves as a basis for a PhD in African American Studies or in an affiliated field.

## Awards and Scholarships

Most students receive some form of financial aid to help them pay for graduate school. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University use to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. The department offers a limited number of assistantships and scholarships on a highly competitive basis. The awards usually involve teaching or assisting one or more faculty with instructional duties.
