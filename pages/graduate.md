## Temple Graduate School Funding
Temple has several financial aid packages available to eligible candidates, including University Fellowships, Future Faculty Fellowships and Teaching Assistantships. These funding packages are awarded on a competitive basis. University and Future Faculty Fellows do not have to teach in their first year; however, they must serve as teaching assistants in their second year (and their stipends are reduced accordingly). The department program determines nomination for fellowships. Nominations are then decided by the Graduate School, which usually looks at traditional markers of academic excellence, (i.e., GPA, GRE scores). Funding is very limited and so MA students are normally not eligible for funding. In rare cases, MA students are selected by the Graduate Director for TAships and fellowships. If you do receive funding from Temple, you can borrow from the regular financial aid programs. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.
