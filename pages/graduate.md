We are well-known for our innovation, energy and influence in Black studies. Temple’s professors have published more books than any other department of African American Studies faculty in the nation. Our graduates lead more programs in African American studies than any other similar program.

## PhD in African American Studies
Temple was the first university to offer a PhD program in African American Studies. Our program reflects a deep commitment to the Afrocentric, or self-directed, exploration of academic experiences. It is the goal of the department that graduates of our PhD program are prepared to engage in a diverse range of intellectual issues that affect the lives of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora. Our students are prepared for university teaching and scholarly research; our graduates have excellent employment track records in major universities nationwide.

## MA in African American Studies
The MA in African American Studies is designed to teach students about fundamental theoretical and practical issues confronting African people trans-continentally and trans-generationally. The MA program seeks to answer the personal and intellectual aspirations of students that are not satisfied by a BA degree in African American Studies. An MA in African American Studies often serves as a basis for a PhD in the discipline or in an affiliated field.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Temple has several financial aid packages available to eligible candidates, including University Fellowships, Future Faculty Fellowships and Teaching Assistantships. These funding packages are awarded on a competitive basis. University and Future Faculty Fellows do not have to teach in their first year; however, they must serve as teaching assistants in their second year (and their stipends are reduced accordingly). The department program determines nomination for fellowships. Nominations are then decided by the Graduate School, which usually looks at traditional markers of academic excellence, (i.e., GPA, GRE scores). Funding is very limited and so MA students are normally not eligible for funding. In rare cases, MA students are selected by the Graduate Director for TAships and fellowships. If you do receive funding from Temple, you can borrow from the regular financial aid programs. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. For more information about funding, review our admissions procedures.
