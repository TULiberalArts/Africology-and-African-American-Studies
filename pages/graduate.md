## Earn an MA or PhD in African American Studies

The Department of Africology and African American Studies provides graduate and doctoral level students with an Afrocentric study of the history, culture, art, politics and economics of Africans, African Americans and people of African descent globally. We are known for our innovation, energy and influence in Black Studies, and our professors have published more books than any other Department of African American Studies in the nation. Temple graduates have published more than 100 books, and lead more programs in African American Studies than graduates of any other similar program. 

## Get Involved in the Academic Community

Our faculty edits the top journal in our discipline, the Journal of Black Studies, and faculty members participate in all the significant associations including the National Council for Black Studies and Afrocentricity International. We encourage our students to collaborate with faculty in research, conferences, field trips and joint writing projects. If you join our program, you'll have the opportunity to contribute to the Journal of Black Studies and participate in African American Studies conferences alongside us. 

## PhD in African American Studies

Temple is the first University that offer a PhD program in African American Studies. The program reflects a deep commitment to the self-directed study of African peoples; Our courses and programs give students the opportunity to explore a variety of academic experiences from the standpoint of African agency. Our students are prepared for university teaching and scholarly research and have excellent employment track records.

## MA in African American Studies

The MA in African American Studies is designed to teach students about fundamental theoretical and practical issues confronting African people trans-continentally and trans-generationally. The MA program seeks to answer personal and intellectual aspirations of students that are not satisfied by a BA degree in African American Studies. An MA in African American Studies often serves as a basis for a PhD in African American Studies or in an affiliated field.

## Financial Aid and Scholarships for Graduate School

Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. We encourage you to explore all of the opportunities available and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. 

Our department also offers a limited number of assistantships and merit-based scholarships for graduate students on a highly competitive basis. An assistantship provides some or all of the funding needed for grad school while the you are working for Temple University in some capacity. Merit-based scholarships are awarded to students with exceptional achievements relating to African American Studies.
