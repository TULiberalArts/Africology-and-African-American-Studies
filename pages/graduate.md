## Earn an MA or PhD in African American Studies
The Department of Africology and African American Studies provides graduate and doctoral-level students with an Afrocentric study of the history, culture, art, politics and economics of Africans, African Americans and people of African descent. We are well-known for our innovation, energy and influence in Black studies; Temple’s professors have published more books than any other department of African American Studies faculty in the nation. Our graduates lead more programs in African American studies than any other similar program.

### Get Involved in the Black Studies Academic Community
Our faculty edits the top journal in our discipline, the _Journal of Black Studies_. We also participate in all the significant associations in our discipline, including the National Council for Black Studies and Afrocentricity International. We encourage our students to collaborate with faculty in research, conferences, field trips and joint writing projects. If you join our program, you'll have the opportunity to contribute to the _Journal of Black Studies_ and participate in African American Studies conferences with us.

### PhD in African American Studies
Temple was the first university to offer a PhD program in African American Studies. Our program reflects a deep commitment to the Afrocentric, or self-directed, exploration of academic experiences. It is the goal of the department that graduates of our PhD program are prepared to engage in a diverse range of intellectual issues that affect the lives of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora. Our students are prepared for university teaching and scholarly research; our graduates have excellent employment track records in major universities nationwide.

### MA in African American Studies
The MA in African American Studies is designed to teach students about fundamental theoretical and practical issues confronting African people trans-continentally and trans-generationally. The MA program seeks to answer the personal and intellectual aspirations of students that are not satisfied by a BA degree in African American Studies. An MA in African American Studies often serves as a basis for a PhD in the discipline or in an affiliated field.
