## Program Overview

The Department of African American Studies offers full-time graduate work leading to a Master’s and PhD in African American Studies.  The graduate programs at Temple are trans-continental and trans-generational in their integrated approach to domestic and international issues in African phenomena. Thus, we encourage our students to explore either the social-behavioral or the cultural-aesthetic concentrations in our graduate programs. Many students discover that they prefer to take the core courses and then to have a trans-concentration emphasis in their work.

Although we encourage students to take cognate courses we insist that the field of African American Studies is not merely an aggregation of courses about African people, but a focused, disciplined, and rigorous perspective on phenomena related to African people in Africa, the Caribbean and the Americas. Our Master’s degree (MA) and our Doctoral Degree (PHD) are well known for their innovation, energy, and influence in the academy. As the oldest PhD program in the nation we are capable of providing students with our experience of having trained more than one hundred and sixty (160) Phds in African American Studies.
