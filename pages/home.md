  One of the oldest of similar departments in the nation, and we were the first
  to offer a doctoral program in our field. Our department emerged during the
  Black Power movement, when black students demanded a Black Studies department
  to combat racism, discrimination, and oppression. As a result, the Afro-Asian
  Institute was created in 1971, and the Pan African Studies Department was
  established the following year.

Templeâ€™s Department of Africology and African American Studies is one of the oldest of similar departments in the nation, and we were the first to offer a doctoral program in our field. Our department emerged during the Black Power movement, when black students demanded a Black Studies department to combat racism, discrimination, and oppression. As a result, the Afro-Asian Institute was created in 1971, and the Pan African Studies Department was established the following year. Our faculty edits the Journal of Black Studies, the top journal in the field. We attract and produce world-class scholars in Black Studies, and have more African American students than any other University in the Northeast.
