The Department of Africology and African American Studies presents students with an ongoing synthesis
of the best research and scholarship on historical, cultural, scientific and economic issues confronting
African and African American people.

Using the African American experience, our discipline provides students with an integrated approach to
social, economic, and cultural questions of origin, diversity, racism, racial relations and expressions of
art and humanities.

We are a trans-generational, transcontinental and interdisciplinary program that seeks to sustain a full analytical and critical discourse on all issues related to the Africana experience.
