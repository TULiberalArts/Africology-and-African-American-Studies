The mission of Temple Universityâ€™s Department of African American Studies is to provide students with a textured intellectual experience through the systematic Afrocentric study of the thought, behavior and practices of African people in the Americas, the Caribbean and the continent of Africa. As such we are a trans-generational and trans-continental program that seeks to sustain a full analytical and critical discourse on all issues related to the Africana experience. In as much as our faculty and students pursue knowledge from the internal perspective of African people as agents and subjects of experience we also remain open to plural understandings and the multicultural nature of contemporary society.

Thus, while we emphasize and encourage the Afrocentric study of phenomena we are committed to engagement with scholars on comparative analysis of African societies, class and gender critiques of established regimes, and historical and archival materials that impinge on knowledge of the African world. Our department expects students to reach for excellence by interrogating African cultural frames of reference, from the classical to the contemporary period, while plunging into the depths of African continuities in Diaspora communities. This means that we have as a part of our mission the exploration of issues of race, ethnicity, and African regionalism over time and place.
