## African American Studies at Temple
The Department of Africology and African American Studies attracts and produces world-class scholars in our discipline and we have more African American students than any other university in the Northeast. We constantly seek to expand links with the local, national and international African community; our focus is trans-generational, transcontinental and interdisiplinary. Our faculty edits the _Journal of Black Studies_, the top peer-reviewed publication in our academic discipline. We always encourage our students to take advantage of opportunities to engage in service learning, internships and study abroad â€” including a [summer program in Ghana](https://studyabroad.temple.edu/sites/temple-summer-in-ghana). Our courses and programs are Afrocentric, meaning that we explore academic topics from the standpoint of African agency.

## First in Our Field
Become a part of an energetic group of scholars who seek to continue what began more than 40 years ago. Our Africology and African American Studies department is one of the oldest of similar programs in the nation, and we were the first to offer a doctoral program in our field. It emerged during the Black Power movement, when black students demanded a Black Studies department to combat racism, discrimination and oppression. As a result, the Afro-Asian Institute was created in 1971, and the Pan African Studies Department was established the following year.
