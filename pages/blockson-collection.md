> “My main goal in life is to build a good library of Black history - knowledge is a form of Black power and this is my part in it,” - Charles L. Blockson, Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection

Among the largest collections of artifacts relating to Black culture and history, The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University houses over 500,000 items related tp the global Black experience. Located in Sullivan Hall, the extensive catalog dates from 1581 to the present, and offers students an excellent opportunity to enhance their academic research. 

## History of the Blockson Collection

Accumulated by historian and author Charles L. Blockson, the Blockson Collection contains materials on the global Black experience in all formats: rare books; pamphlets; newsletters; busts and statues; photographs; posters; sheet music and oral histories. The Collection's rare books section is particularly strong in its first editions, as well as its holdings in African, African-American and African-Caribbean publications dating back to the sixteenth century.

Blockson's collection includes:

- First-edition works of Phyllis Wheatley and W.E.B. DuBois
- Narratives by Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass
- Assorted correspondence of Haitian Revolutionaries
- Paul Robeson's sheet music

Donated in 1984, Mr. Blockson chose Temple University to house his collection because of our diverse student body and location in the heart of the African American community in North Philadelphia. The bibliophile, author and historian has a special connection to the city, based on his ancestral connection with the Underground Railroad.

Charles L. Blockson began collecting artifacts documenting the story of African Americans at age nine. He began collecting in fifth grade after a startling classroom conversation about American history.

> “I raised my hand and asked the teacher, ‘Did Negroes ever contribute to American history?’” Blockson told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2013. “She said: ‘No, Charles. Negroes were born to serve white people.’”

The incident set Mr. Blockson on the path of historical collection that he has followed for the past seven decades. His journey to document African American history and culture has put him in touch with Malcolm X; Rosa Parks; Marian Anderson; Paul Robeson and Langston Hughs. The historian and scholar is the author of 13 books, including 2 on the Underground Railroad, which he is an expert on. 

One of Mr. Blockson’s proudest achievements was getting a state historical marker placed at Penn’s Landing in Philadelphia near Independence Seaport Museum that recognizes Pennsylvania’s role in the slave trade. The marker was unveiled in August 2016.
