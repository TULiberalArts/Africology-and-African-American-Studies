> “My main goal in life is to build a good library of Black history - knowledge is a form of Black power and this is my part in it,” - Charles L. Blockson, Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection

Among the largest collections of items relating to Black culture and history, The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University in Philadelphia houses over 500,000 items on the global Black experience dating from 1581 to the present. Located in Sullivan Hall, the extensive catalog is the first to be published by a major university. The Blockson Collection demonstrates that Black history is valuable, and offers students a rare opportunity to learn about this history firsthand. As an African American Studies student, you'll have the opportunity to access the research facility to enhance your acedemic research throughout your time at Temple. 

## History of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection

Accumulated by historian and author Charles L. Blockson, the Blockson Collection contains materials on the global black experience in all formats: rare books; pamphlets; newsletters; busts and statues; photographs; posters; sheet music and oral histories. Blockson's collection specifically includes:

-First-edition works of Phyllis Wheatley and W.E.B. DuBois
-Narratives by Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass
-Assorted correspondence of Haitian Revolutionaries
-Paul Robeson's sheet music

Donated in 1984, Mr. Blockson Temple University to house his collection because of our diverse student body and location in the heart of the African American community in North Philadelphia. The bibliophile, author and historian has a special connection to the city, based on his ancestral connection with the Underground Railroad. 

## Charles L. Blockson

Prominent African American historian and scholar Charles L. Blockson began collecting artifacts documenting the story of African Americans at age nine. He began collecting all the way back in fifth grade after a startling classroom conversation about American history.

“I raised my hand and asked the teacher, ‘Did Negroes ever contribute to American history?’” Blockson told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2013. “She said: ‘No, Charles. Negroes were born to serve white people.’”

That incident set Blockson on the path of historical collection that he has followed for the past seven decades. His journey to document African American history and culture has put him in touch with Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Marian Anderson, Paul Robeson and Langston Hughs. The historian and scholar is the author of 13 books, including 2 on the Underground Railroad, which is an expert on. One of Blockson’s proudest achievements was getting a state historical marker placed at Penn’s Landing in Philadelphia near Independence Seaport Museum that recognizes Pennsylvania’s role in the slave trade. The marker was unveiled in August 2016.
