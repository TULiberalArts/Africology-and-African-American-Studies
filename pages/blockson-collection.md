Among the largest collections of items relating to Black culture and history, The Charles L.

Located in Sullivan Hall, the extensive catalog is the first to be published by a major university.

As an African American Studies student, you'll have the opportunity to access the research facility to enhance your acedemic research throughout your time at Temple. 

## African American History and Culture

Accumulated by historian and author Charles L. Blockson, the Blockson Collection contains materials on the global black experience in all formats: rare books; pamphlets; newsletters; busts and statues; photographs; posters; sheet music and oral histories. Considered one of the foremost experts on the Underground Railroad, Blockson's private collection specifically includes the first-edition works of Phyllis Wheatley and W.E.B. DuBois; narratives by Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass; and the assorted correspondence of Haitian Revolutionaries and Paul Robeson's sheet music. 


> “My main goal in life is to build a good library of Black history - knowledge is a form of Black power and this is my part in it,” stated Charles L. Blockson, curator of the extensive collections in African-Amercana. "Scholars from all over the world, indeed, anyone who is interested in the rich cultural heritage of African-Americans, will welcome this long-awaited and much-needed resource.”
